        Classroom Lectures or Live Sessions
    </h4>
    <p>
        We are going to have several live sessions for this module. These sessions will give us a chance to all be online at the same time and interact and ask questions. Attendance is mandatory. If you can’t join live, you will be able to watch a recording of the session.

        Designed to support you in your studies, these 3-hour virtual classroom sessions will be based on a number of activities to consolidate topics presented each week via the MyLMS platform. Delivered by experienced lecturers, the sessions are interactive, and students will have the opportunity to contribute to the discussion, collaborate with others, and clarify challenging aspects of the module. The sessions are a supplement to the student’s own self-directed learning; students are required to have completed the learning activities for the week, prior to joining these sessions.
